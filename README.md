# COVID-19 Tweets Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to COVID-19. With the outbreak of the pandemic, social media platforms have become a significant source of information and expression of public sentiment. Analyzing tweets can provide insights into public opinions, concerns, and emotions regarding the COVID-19 situation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the analysis)

## Data 
- The dataset used in this project consists of tweets collected using kaggle that you can find here: [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datatattle/covid-19-nlp-text-classification).
- Data preprocessing techniques such as text cleaning, tokenization, and lemmatization are applied to prepare the text data for sentiment analysis.

## Analysis
- Sentiment analysis is performed using machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the performance of each classifier.
- Visualization techniques such as bar plots, pie charts, and word clouds are used to visualize sentiment distribution and most frequent words.

## Results
- The analysis provides insights into the sentiment trends of COVID-19 tweets, including positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
- The most common topics and concerns expressed in the tweets are identified through word frequency analysis and word clouds.
- Comparative analysis of different classifiers is presented to determine the most effective approach for sentiment analysis of COVID-19 tweets.
